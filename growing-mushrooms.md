# Home-grown mushrooms need a high humidity environment

I tried growing [oyster mushrooms 🍄](https://beyondcoffeeshop.dk/shop/6-alle-produkter/64-gro-saet/) at home, but they suffered from:

* 😢 Stunted growth
* 😢 Hard, shrivelled, yellowed caps

It turns out that my house was too dry. To fix this, I put the mushroom growing kit in a **transparent plastic box** that I **regularly misted with water from a spray bottle**.
